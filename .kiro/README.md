# AI-DLC — AI Development Lifecycle Skills

[![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-blue)](CHANGELOG.md)

An opinionated implementation of the [AI-DLC (AI-Driven Development Life Cycle)](https://prod.d13rzhkk8cj2z0.amplifyapp.com/) methodology as a portable skill harness for AI coding assistants.

This project implements AIDLC principles — decision-driven phases, manifest-based state, and human-in-the-loop control — with a focus on **portability** and **simplicity**. Skills are plain markdown files that work across platforms without runtime dependencies, custom tooling, or platform lock-in.

For the official AIDLC workflow definitions maintained by AWS, see [awslabs/aidlc-workflows](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows). For a detailed comparison, see [docs/comparison.md](docs/comparison.md).

## Why AI-DLC

AI coding assistants are powerful but undirected. Without structure, they produce inconsistent architectures, skip edge cases, and make technology choices that don't align with your project. AI-DLC introduces a lightweight lifecycle that keeps the AI focused and the human in control.

- **Decision gates** at each phase surface the right questions and validate answers before moving forward
- **Traceability** enforced across the full chain — requirements → design → tasks → build verification
- **Manifest-based state tracking** lets you pause, resume, and roll back across sessions
- **Scope-adaptive workflow** — auto-detects if you're building a new project, adding a feature, fixing a bug, or refactoring
- **Incremental delivery** for complex projects — decompose into units, design and implement one at a time
- **Parallel implementation** via sub-agents with file ownership isolation
- **Learning loop** — human corrections persist as project rules for future workflows
- **Multi-language** — all artifacts and responses generated in the user's language
- **Multi-platform** — works on Kiro (IDE and CLI) and Claude Code

## Quick Start

### Installation

Clone the repo and copy the skills into your project:

```bash
git clone <repo-url> aidlc-skills
cd aidlc-skills
```

**Kiro (IDE or CLI):**
```bash
cp -r skills/aidlc* /path/to/your/project/.kiro/skills/
```

**Claude Code:**
```bash
cp -r skills/aidlc* /path/to/your/project/.claude/skills/
```

#### Optional: Install as Kiro Power

1. Open the **Powers** panel (Command Palette → "Powers: Open Panel")
2. Click **"Add Custom Power"** → **"Import power from a folder"**
3. Select the `powers/aidlc` folder from this repo

### Your First Feature

Just tell the AI what you want to build:

```
/aidlc build a todo app with user authentication, task management, and notifications
```

Or point it to an existing requirements document:

```
/aidlc build the application described in docs/requirements.md
```

Try one of the [example requirements](examples/requirements/) included in this repo:

```
/aidlc build the application described in examples/requirements/requirements-en-art-toys.md
```

### Available Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---|---|
| `start` | Begin a new feature specification |
| `resume` | Pick up where you left off |
| `status` | Show current workflow progress |
| `next` | Continue to the next phase |
| `rollback` | Go back to a previous phase |
| `repair` | Rebuild manifest from disk artifacts |
| `quick` | Single-pass spec for simple brownfield features |
| `doctor` | Verify installation health |
| `scope [name]` | Change workflow scope (new/feature/bugfix/refactor) |
| `prototype` | Build a throwaway spike to validate requirements |
| `review` | Run solutions review or code review |
| `reverse-engineer` | Deep codebase analysis (13 reports) |
| Phase names | Jump directly: `context`, `requirements`, `design`, `tasks`, `implement`, `build`, `deploy` |

> **Note**: `units` and `decomposition` refer to the same phase — both work interchangeably.

## Workflow Overview

AI-DLC organizes the development lifecycle into three phases:

| Phase | Covers | Skills |
|---|---|---|
| **Inception** | Context assessment, requirements, decomposition into units | aidlc-context, aidlc-requirements, aidlc-decomposition |
| **Construction** | Technology decisions, design, task planning, implementation | aidlc-design, aidlc-tasks, aidlc-implement |
| **Operation** | Build verification, CI/CD pipeline generation, deployment | aidlc-build, aidlc-deploy |

### Scope-Adaptive Workflow

The workflow adapts to your task. Scope is auto-detected from your request and workspace, or you can set it manually with `scope [name]`.

| Scope | Phases | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| `new` | All phases | New projects, rewrites |
| `feature` | All phases | Adding capability to existing code |
| `bugfix` | Context → Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implement → Build | Fixing specific bugs (skips decomposition, deploy) |
| `refactor` | Context → Design → Tasks → Implement → Build | Restructuring code (skips requirements, decomposition, deploy) |

    subgraph Inception
        A[Context] --> B[Requirements]
        B --> C{Complex?}
        C -->|Complex| E[Decomposition]
    end

    subgraph Construction
        C -->|Simple| D[Design]
        D --> T[Tasks]
        T --> I[Implement]
        E --> Units
        subgraph Units ["For Each Unit"]
            direction TB
            UD[Design] --> UT[Tasks] --> UI[Implement]
        end
    end

    subgraph Operation
        BT[Build and Test]
        DEP[Deploy]
        BT --> DEP
    end

    Units --> BT
    I --> BT
    B -.->|optional| P[Prototype]
    P -.->|refine| B
```

**Simple projects** go straight from requirements to design → implement → build → deploy.

**Complex projects** (5+ stories, 2+ domains) decompose into units, then design and implement each independently before building and deploying.

### Key Behaviors

**Traceability**: Every phase must account for upstream items. Design traces to requirements, tasks trace to design components, and the build phase verifies end-to-end coverage. Gaps must be documented with justification.

**Human-in-the-loop (incremental mode)**: After each unit phase (design, tasks, implement), control returns to the Unit Dashboard. The user decides what to work on next — not the workflow. Decision gates (D3, D4) are always fresh per unit.

**Learning loop**: When the user corrects an artifact and the correction represents a general rule, the workflow asks whether to remember it. Accepted corrections are stored in `corrections.md` and loaded in all future sessions.

**Session recovery**: On resume after a session break, the orchestrator re-reads the manifest, re-loads all templates from disk, and dispatches the correct skill. No artifacts are generated from memory.

**Language**: All artifacts and responses are generated in the user's detected language. Only code, file paths, YAML keys, and technical terms stay in English.

**Context rot prevention**: Long sessions can cause instruction drift where the agent skips checkpoints. AI-DLC mitigates this with PreToolUse hooks (Kiro, Claude Code) that remind the agent of workflow rules before every write, and behavioral anchors in steering files that persist across the session. See [Context Rot](docs/context-rot.md) for details.
